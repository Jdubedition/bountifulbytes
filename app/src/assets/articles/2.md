# What is Docker?

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a platform that provides a simple way to run applications in a lightweight container.  Let's first mention a bit about containers, as there are two main implementations that use the concept of a container.  The [Docker container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) is one type of container technology, but there is also the [Linux container](https://linuxcontainers.org/).  The former focuses on packaging and running applications, while the latter focuses on packaging and running operating systems.  For this article, we will be focusing on Docker containers.  Maybe in a future article I will cover Linux containers. :wink:

## Introduction to Docker
Use these [installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your operating system.

Make sure you can successfully run the hello-world image.  If you are using Linux (like me), you will need to prefix this and other calls to `docker` with `sudo`.
```text
docker run hello-world
```
You should see output similar to this (also read the output because it has important information for you):
```text
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
 https://hub.docker.com/

For more examples and ideas, visit:
 https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
```

Now we will do what they suggest in the output from the hello-world image, and run an Ubuntu container. :grin:  This will start a container (instance of the image) that is running Ubuntu with the bash shell as the application/command we want to run.  One way to think about the relationship between an image and container is that of a recipe for a cake and a cake itself.
```text
docker run -it ubuntu bash
```

If this is the first time running the command above or it has been a while since you ran it, you will see something like this:
```text
Unable to find image 'ubuntu:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/ubuntu
```

What is happening here is that the version of the image (latest tag) is not available on your machine.  So the `docker` client will try downloading the image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).  This is a great service that the Docker team provides, as most Docker images are built off of other images that are pulled from this image repository.  There are other Docker image repositories that other companies offer, but Docker Hub is the original one and the source for most images.  Any of the Docker image repositories enable you to download the image, versus needing to download the source code, Dockerfile definition, and build it yourself.  Later in this article we will cover how to build images from source code.

You should now be int the shell of the container.  Your terminal should have switched to display `root@<container-id>`.  You can run commands in the container by typing them into the terminal.  For example, to run `ls` in the container, type `ls`.  You should see the following output:
```text
bin   dev  home  lib32  libx32  mnt  proc  run   srv  tmp  var
boot  etc  lib   lib64  media   opt  root  sbin  sys  usr
```

Also, let's run top to see what processes are running in the container.  Type `top` and you should see output like this:

![](ubuntu-container-top-screenshot.jpg)

Press `q` to exit the top application.

Open another terminal and type `docker ps` to see the container listing.  This shows currently running container, and you should see output similar to this:
```text
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
2273d409340c   ubuntu    "bash"    11 minutes ago   Up 11 minutes             sweet_cori
```

We could go back to our bash shell and type `exit` to exit the container.  But we can also use `docker stop` to stop the container.  Type `docker stop <container-id>` to stop the container.  We will use the stop command to clean up our container.  For a shortcut you can use just the first three letters of the container ID.

After stopping the container, run `docker ps` again and you should no longer see the container.

With the very basics of using Docker in place, let's take a look at how containers wrap applications with their dependencies and enable us to run them without installing anything else.

## Digging into Docker with our own application

Open the Github repository (will probably use repo for short, most of the time :smile:) [docker-polyglot-world](https://github.com/Jdubedition/docker-polyglot-world).  This repo contains Dockerfile definitions that wrap a simple hello-world web application, which is implemented in a variety of programming languages and frameworks.  We will use this repo to build containers that runs the hello-world web application.

To clone this Github repo, you need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed on your machine.  With Git installed you can now clone the repo.  Find a directory on your machine that you want to have the docker-polyglot-world directory/repository added to.
```text
git clone https://github.com/Jdubedition/docker-polyglot-world.git
```

Navigate to the directory.
```text
cd docker-polyglot-world
```

We can now build the container image.
```text
docker build -t python-docker-polyglot-world -f python/python.Dockerfile python
```

There will be a lot of output, but at the end you should see something like the following:
```text
Successfully built <GENERATED VALUE HERE>
Successfully tagged python-docker-polyglot-world:latest
```

You can see this image being available by checking the images on your machine.
```text
docker images
```

### Small dive into keywords of a Dockerfile :upside_down_face:
To gain a better appreciation of what just happened, let's review the `python.Dockerfile` file in the Git repository.  This file is located in the `python` directory.  Open the file in your favorite text editor.

There are four Dockerfile keywords that I think are very important to understand, as they serve the core functionality for building a Docker image.  First keyword you will see, in the file opened in the previous paragraph, is `FROM`.  "FROM" says which image this Dockerfile is going to use to build upon.  As mentioned earlier in this article, most images referenced in this statement will use Docker Hub, but you can also reference other Docker image repositories.

The next keyword that is used quite often is `RUN`.  This keyword allows you to execute a command/application against the base imaged mentioned in the `FROM` statement.  The results of the command will be preserved as a [layer](https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/#images-and-layers) in your Docker image.  I recommend reading a little more about layers by clicking on the link in the previous sentence.

`COPY` is the third keyword I want to cover.  This command is very important as it enables bringing files/directories from the machine building the Docker image, into a layer in the Docker image itself.  Quick note, there is the `ADD` keyword as well, but you will see `COPY` much more often because it is the [recommended option](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#add-or-copy) by the Docker team.

The last keyword I want to cover is actually two keywords that are very similar.  The pair is `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT`.  They both allow you to define a command/application that will be executed when the container is started.  The subtle difference between the two is that `CMD` is easier to override when starting the container, hinting the developer using the image that they can do something else with the container.  `ENTRYPOINT` is hinting that this is the expected way to run this container.  With that said, the two keywords can be used together as well.  `ENTRYPOINT` would provide the part that the developer should not override and `CMD` would provide the part that the developer can override.  So, depending on the intention of the image creator, will determine which of the three patterns you will see.  That said, for the examples in the `docker-polyglot-world` repository, I will use `CMD` because I want you be able to override the default behavior of the container.

### ... and now back to our example :grin:

With our `python-docker-polygot-world` image built, we can now create and run a container from it.
```text
docker run -it -p 8080:80 python-docker-polyglot-world
```

A note on the flags provided to `docker run`, `-it` if for interactive TTY, enabling you to interact with the application running in your container as though it was running in your terminal.  If you use `CTRL-C`, it will stop the container.  `-p` is for port forwarding, allowing you to access the container's web application on port 8080 from your machine.  You will notice that we provide 8080:80 as an argument to the flag.  That says the container is exposing port 80, but we want to map it to our machines prot 8080.  We can now access the web application by going to http://localhost:8080.  If using your browser or CLI tool like curl, you should get similar JSON content as provided below.  The "from" value will be the hostname for your container.
```json
{"hello":"World","from":"8afb4f576fb7"}
```

From here you can play around with this application and repository. The following are suggestions:
* Change the application code to return different values in the JSON payload, build the image again, and run the container again.
* Build and run the other Docker images that in this repository for the different languages.  See how each implementation is different but returns the same JSON payload.
* If you are feeling especially bold, try adding another programming language to the repository (following the pattern of the other languages) and the associated Dockerfile.  If you get that working and you want to contribute to this repository, please do so!  You will need to fork the Github repository, clone it to your machine, apply the changes, update the readme, and then open a pull request.  I will review and approve your pull request or suggest changes before merging it.

I will be adding new languages to the `docker-polyglot-world` repository over time, but contributions are welcome.
