# What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is a fantastic technology that enables building distributed systems.  Distributed systems are important because they enable us to build services that can scale to meet demand, can be resilient to failure, and can reduce latency from request to response.  With the benefits of distributed systems comes many complexities, such as how do you keep everything aligned and how do you know the state of the system?  Kubernetes serves as the core to a distributed systems solution, but as you dive more into it you will find that it is just a piece in a very large puzzle.  This is article one of many, that can be found at [justink8s.com](https://justink8s.com), which will explore the expansive ecosystem of Kubernetes and its associates.

# Ways to acquire and run applications
Let's use the ever popular NGINX application (read about it here: [NGINX](https://nginx.org/en/)) as our point of explanation.

### Get an application:
* Write the application :smile:

* You could download the application from [source](https://hg.nginx.org/nginx) and [build](https://nginx.org/en/docs/configure.html) the application/binary yourself.

* Download a [pre-built binary](https://nginx.org/en/download.html) (for Windows).

* Get it from a [package manager](https://nginx.org/en/linux_packages.html), for example in Ubuntu 20.04 you can install it with this command.  Note, this will also setup a service to automatically run the application for you.
```bash
apt install nginx
```

* Download the Docker container image from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx), you will need the [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) application to do this.
```bash
docker pull nginx
```

### Running the application:
* If you downloaded or built the binary, you can call that binary to execute it directly.
```bash
./nginx
```

* If you used a package manager, then NGINX may already be running but you can check the location of it.
```bash
which nginx
```

* Lastly, and most importantly for Kubernetes, is the Docker image.  To create a container instance from the image we downloaded earlier, we will use the following command.  Note, I have set the port to 8080 and interactive TTY (allows the stdout to be linked to terminal instance) in this example.
```bash
docker run -it -p 8080:80 nginx
```

With the application running, you should now be able to open a browser and type http://localhost or http://localhost:8080 (depending if you changed the default port) and view the NGINX root page.
