# bountifulbytes

Welcome to the repository for [bountifulbytes.com](https://bountifulbytes.com "bountifulbytes.com").  This repository shares what it takes to make the website happen.

Originally, this website was built using [Docker](https://www.docker.com) containers, [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), [Linode](https://www.linode.com) and [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com).  However, in an effort to simplify the process, reduce costs, and improve security, I have decided to move the website to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) and allow Cloudflare to handle all of the complexity.
